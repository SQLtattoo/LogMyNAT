# LogMyNAT
A simple app that logs the public IP changes of your router's NATed IP.

The idea came from alerts that I was getting from Azure regarding risky signins in the Azure tenant. 
I wanted a way to correlate my IP with the risky signin logged.
The problem is that my IP at home is dynamic so it was changing and it was difficult to keep track.
Then LogMyNAT was born :)

Enjoy and feel free to use and/or enhance.
